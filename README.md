# JS infinite typewriter algorithm

This is a very interesting theoretical algorithm implemented in Javascript. It works like this:

Theoretically, if you get infinite monkeys and give each one a typewriter, eventually one will make something meaningful. Like writing a book, or perhaps, solving an NP hard problem.
This algorithm simulates this. It generates `pseudo-algorithms` from random strings, if it can eval it, the result may be actually working, if not, it throws it away.

## Usage

Run the code with a Javascript interpreter and configure it to fit your needs.
